YouTube, a Google company, has over a billion users and generate billions of views. Since YouTube data is getting created in a very huge amount and with an equally great speed, there is a huge demand to store, process and carefully study this large amount of data to make it usable The main objective of this project is to demonstrate by using Hadoop concepts, how data generated from YouTube can be mined and utilized to make targeted, real time and informed decision
